# ComputerVision661
Repository for final project in 601.661 Computer Vision

The aim of this project is to produce a small game in which a user can use an object to "play" an instrument virtually. The program supports detection of up to two objects.
The first object is a yellow ball and the second object is a red ball. Here is a demo video (TODO: Link demo).

If you would like to run this, clone this repository, type the following commands (assuming you have python 3 and pip installed):
        
        pip install virtualenv
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/Scripts/activate
        pip install requirements.txt
        
IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are on windows, you will need to do the following to install ffmpeg:
